the problem with this code base is that

- when i add experiments to the cmakelist file it wont build
- when i remove experiments from the cmakelist file it builds
- atom_types file doesnt exist inside attention folder
- there is no agent.h file in the cogserver folder
- so the missing of the above two files lead to build error

possible solutions

- find and add the missing files to the respective folders
- ask someone who knows or run the codebase with some examples to see if it works
- just play with some c++ functions if they work
- study fome of the functions how they work.
