the problem with this code base is that

- when i add experiments to the cmakelist file it wont build
- when i remove experiments from the cmakelist file it builds
- atom_types file doesnt exist inside attention folder
- there is no agent.h file in the cogserver folder
- so the missing of the above two files lead to build error which prevents from building the experiment folder

possible solutions

- find and add the missing files to the respective folders
- ask someone who knows or run the codebase with some examples to see if it works
- just play with some c++ functions if they work
- study fome of the functions how they work.


things i know till now which part of the system is not working

ONE 

- the attention folder can not be built due to missing files on the cogserver 
- specifically the agent module which contain files like agent.h and scheduler.h
- this missing module imported by attention module in the following files

 - attention/imprtanceDiffusionBase.h
 - attention/AFRentCollectionAgent.h
 - attention/AttentionModule.cc etc ...

- not only agent module is missing but the same file is tried to be included with different path 
- which is not exist in the system, specifically the Agent.h file in the cogserver repository

MORE DETAIL

- the /Agent.h file is tried to be imported from <opencog/cogserver/server/Agent.h> inside /experiments/ExperimentSetupModule.h and /examples/hopfield/imprintAgent.h files and also
- the /Agent.h file is tried to be imported from <opencog/cogserver/modules/agents/Agent.h> inside /attention/AFRentCollectionAgents.h and other files

i dont know if they are different files with the same file name though!
 
TWO 

- the attention module is not added during the project building

THREE 

- the experiments folder is not added during the project building


HOPE 

- asking someone who knows the codebase to run the codebase with some examples to see if it works

TILL THEN

- just play with some c++ functions if they work
- study some of agent implementation functions how they work.


THINGS TO CHECK OUT

- check the test files found inside attention and attention bank subfolders how they are testing the corresponding functions
- study the testd function along with thire testing mechanizm 


WAYS WE TRIED OUT

- we found that the agent module is deleted at <commit> commit
- we tried get the agent module in the cogserver repository from specific commit back and build with the recent commit but it didn't work
- we tried to build the cogserver before the agent module deleted but it didnt work



so we concluded that to build the attention module we need the agent module 
which is deleted at <commit> commit from the cogserver repository
